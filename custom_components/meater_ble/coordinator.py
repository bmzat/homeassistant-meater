"""DataUpdateCoordinator for the MEATER BLE integration.

The original MEATER and MEATER+ probes expose temperature and battery data
exclusively via GATT - there is nothing useful in the advertisement payload. They
support only one concurrent BLE connection, so the MEATER app or Block must be
closed before HA can connect.

This coordinator maintains a persistent GATT connection. Connections go through
bleak_retry_connector.establish_connection (the same helper HA's own BLE
integrations use), which transparently handles ESP32/ESPHome proxies, stale
BLEDevice handles, and transient connection errors with retry + backoff.

Data flows two ways, so the integration works across the whole MEATER family and
survives a half-open link:

* GATT notify. The MEATER 2 Plus / Pro push temperature automatically after
  subscribing, so notifications give low-latency updates when they arrive.
* An active read poll. The coordinator also reads the temperature characteristic on a
  timer. This is the reliable data path for probes that are read-populated (the original
  MEATER/MEATER+ appear to be), and it doubles as a liveness probe: a read that fails or
  hangs is a definitive sign of a dead link. It is also a keepalive: the read traffic keeps
  the GATT link engaged. The original holds a rock-solid connection at the base cadence,
  while the Pro / MEATER 2 Plus drops an idle link far sooner on the same proxy (see #5), so
  the Pro is polled on a shorter cadence rather than left to its notifications alone.
  Battery is read on a slow cadence for every probe (byte 0 of the Pro / 2 Plus 5-byte
  payload is the charge percentage). If neither
  notify nor a successful read produces data within a stall window, the link is treated as
  half-open (a common ESP32/ESPHome-proxy failure where the GATT layer dies but the proxy
  keeps the connection slot) and the connection is torn down and re-established. A passive
  notify-silence timer alone cannot
  catch this, because a half-open drop often fires no Bleak disconnect callback at all.

Reconnection is both event-driven and self-scheduling. A bluetooth advertisement
callback fires whenever the probe is seen in range by ANY scanner - connectable or
not - and a self-rescheduling backoff loop keeps retrying while disconnected even
when no connectable adapter has a fresh view of the probe yet. This matters through
Bluetooth proxies: a probe is often heard continuously by a passive (non-connectable)
scanner while the only connectable proxy hears it weakly and intermittently (see #3),
so recovery must not depend on a connectable advertisement alone. A short availability
grace window keeps the last reading visible across brief drops instead of flapping
every entity to unavailable while a reconnect is in flight.

Note: when a probe stops advertising entirely because a Bluetooth proxy is holding a
leaked/half-open connection slot to it, no HA-side API can force a remote proxy to
release that slot (bleak_retry_connector's stale-connection helpers are BlueZ-local
and proxy-blind). The coordinator surfaces this with an actionable warning after
sustained failure to find any connectable path; the fix there is proxy-side (update
ESPHome firmware or reboot the proxy).

Note on the MEATER 2 Plus / Pro specifically (#5): field reports show it can, after a
drop, stop sending connectable advertisements or start refusing/stalling connections
until it is power-cycled on its charger, even with a strong signal and even while a
phone can still see it in a scan. Bluetooth gives no central (a phone, a proxy, or
this integration) a way to open a connection to, or wake, a peripheral that is not
advertising connectably, so this is outside what Home Assistant or the proxy can
influence; a cached-device "connect anyway" attempt was tried and reverted; it cannot
succeed here (Home Assistant's Bluetooth stack only opens a connection to an address a
connectable scanner has recently heard, so it fails identically to waiting). The
keepalive read is the effective mitigation, since it avoids the drop rather than
needing to recover from it.
