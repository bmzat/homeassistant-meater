# HA receives, independent of the scan response. Matching on it is the reliable way to
# auto-discover a MEATER probe through an ESP32/ESPHome proxy, where the local name and
# service UUID (both carried in the scan response) arrive only intermittently (see #3).

# on the original Pro firmware, "meater2" on newer MEATER 2 Plus firmware, when removed
# from its charger). Same characteristic UUIDs as the original but delivers a 12-byte
# temperature payload (6 × signed int16 LE) and a 5-byte battery payload.
#
# This UUID *is* broadcast by the probe - the community M5Stack display discovers the
# probe purely by matching it (isAdvertisingService) under an active scan, and @itsaw's
# nRF Connect capture in #2 lists it under the advertisement. The catch (see #3): the
# service UUID and the local name ride in the SCAN RESPONSE, not the primary ADV_IND, and
# they arrive intermittently - an ESP32/ESPHome proxy does not always forward or merge the
# scan response in time for HA's discovery matcher to fire. So auto-discovery via this
# matcher is best-effort; the manual "add device" flow (which forces an active scan and
# lists every BLE advertisement HA has seen) is the reliable path.

# always-on advertiser (local name "MEATER2"). It is NOT a valid connection target - its
# GATT tree has no temperature/battery characteristics and connecting returns ATT 0x0e
# (see #2). It is used to identify and *exclude* the dock from both auto-discovery (the
# bluetooth step aborts with reason "dock") and the manual picker (skipped via
# _is_dock_only), so a user is never offered the un-connectable dock. It is deliberately
# NOT a manifest auto-discovery matcher.
